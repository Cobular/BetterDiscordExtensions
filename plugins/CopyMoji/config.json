    "description": "By default, when you select and copy text on discord with emojis in it, Discord decides that it should copy the message, not with the emojis as actual emojis, but as `:emojiName:` strings. For standard emojis, this behavior is really dumb!\nTo fix this, I made this plugin, which will change that default behavior. Instead of that, this will make it so that standard emojis (emojis that aren't set custom on a server) are actually copied the way you would expect, so they can be taken into other messaging apps or text documents!",
